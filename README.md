## Inspiration
_______________
## Digital Libraries are vulnerable to shutdown. 

Z Library, Ron DeSantis, etc. 
Libraries only have limited copies of audiobooks and limited resources. 
There's no way to actually own books, and Amazon & other companies have taken over with **unfair subscription models.**
There's no way to onboard the next 100,000 users in Web3 with strictly video games, NFTs, and consumer products. We created an individual ERP Platform curated to help onboard mass adoption by 74% by creating value in a with books and rich resources available online, in a decentralized manner

Mental Wealth Academy is the academic knowledge layer of the project and utilizes a focus on connecting resources and a rich ecosystem while building a community of DAO consensus players to participate.

Mental Wealth Academy is a full-scale full-circle ERP educational platform.

## What It Does & How We Built It
_______
Utilizes DAO Technology on Polygon Network:
- DAO technology ensures that resources are regulated and decentralized.
- Community members vote on resource additions and manage the platform’s evolution.

Complex Smart Contracts:
- Smart contracts are used to store and update the library's directory.
- Implements Chainlink VRF for random selection processes and Chainlink Automation for scheduled governance actions.

IPFS and Piñata for Data Permanence:
- IPFS and Piñata ensure the longevity of resources and documents, providing data permanence.

Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP):
- CCIP is used for NFT book data, enhancing cross-chain communication and asset transfers.

Chainlink Functions:
- Chainlink Functions are used for on-demand resource verification and off-chain data interactions.

Comprehensive Learning Ecosystem:
- Users connect, providing massive learning opportunities for all.
- The marketplace and ecosystem for books and authorship promote reading and writing comprehension.
-Values intellectuals and academics, ensuring Crypto and NFTs become digestible for college students.

## Deployment Strategy and Blockchain Integration
1. Polygon Cardona zkEVM Testnet
Contract Deployment: Deploy the Library Management and DAO Governance contracts on Polygon Cardona zkEVM.
Chainlink Services: Use Chainlink Automation and Chainlink VRF for managing library resources and governance.

2. Polygon Amoy PoS Network
Contract Deployment: Deploy the Treasury Management contract and integrate it with existing DeFi protocols on Polygon Amoy.
Chainlink Services: Use Chainlink Data Feeds and Chainlink Functions for accurate financial management.

3. Avalanche Fuji C-Chain
Contract Deployment: Deploy a cross-chain bridge contract for interoperability between Polygon and Avalanche.
Chainlink Services: Use Chainlink CCIP for cross-chain communication and asset transfers.

4. Scroll Sepolia
Contract Deployment: Deploy the complete set of smart contracts on Scroll Sepolia for testing and verification.
Chainlink Services: Use Chainlink VRF, Automation, and Data Feeds for enhanced functionality and security.

## Challenges & Accomplishments
_____
Timezones were a huge issue to communication... it was actually very frustrating. 
Once we tackled the optimal timezone issues most collaboration went extremely smooth.
Defeating the rough patches, after we set up a few designs and flow charts we were able to communicate with the partners we required to build our individual pieces, it was a rough finish but we did it. I'm proud of my team for completing everything with such limited time and resources. We also gained extensive knowledge of Chainlink's VRF, Automation, Functions, Data Feeds, CCIP, Polygon, Avalanche and Scroll. Understanding the complexities of cross-chain transaction so users can easily buy the books and the purchase the library card and developing a seamless user experience were valuable learning experiences.

## What's next for Mental Wealth Academy
_________
- Continue to build and provide services for communities at scale by onboarding and curating our digital ecosystem to fine tune what resources are exactly needed.
- Applying for Grants: Seeking funding to further develop and expand the platform.
- Mainnet Launch: Deploying Mental Wealth Academy (MWA) on the mainnet for real-world use.
- User Testing: Conducting extensive user testing to refine the platform.
- Mobile App Development: Launching Android and iOS applications for MWA.
- Enhance the AI capabilities used for generating NFT profiles to provide even more personalized and engaging user experiences.
- We also aim to implement gasless transactions by using maybe Biconomy/ Moonbeam to enhance user convenience.
- Support 50+ new tokens and 20+ new chains within the next few months after the end of the hackathon.

By aligning Mental Wealth Academy with the hackathon tracks and integrating multiple Chainlink services, we have created a robust and innovative project.
